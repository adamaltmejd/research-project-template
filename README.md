# Project Template for Research Projects using R

## Setup

To start a new research project, ensure all the requirements are fulfilled then execute the following code in your terminal.

```sh
cookiecutter https://github.com/adamaltmejd/research-project-template
```

Follow the instructions on screen. The template allows you to initialize a Git repository and push the content to Github (or a different remote).

If you are using Github, you need to first set up an **empty** repository. Do not add `.gitignore` or `LICENSE` files when asked.

## Requirements

Using the template requires:

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Renv](https://github.com/rstudio/renv) (optional)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional)

If on Mac, an easy way to install Python and Git is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
