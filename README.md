# Project Template for Research Projects using R

## Setup

To start a new research project, ensure all the requirements are fulfilled then run in your terminal.

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/adamaltmejd/research-project-template
```

You can then follow the instructions on screen. The template allows you to initialize a Git repository and push the content to Github (or a different remote). If using Github, ensure you set up an empty repository before running the code.

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
